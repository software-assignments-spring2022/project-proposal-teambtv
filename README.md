# Project Proposal
Write a proposal for a software product you would like to pursue for the majority of the semester.   Make it obvious, interesting, and make the need for it sound convincing.

## Collaboration
Matthew Shen, Amanda Qiu

## What to include

### Project title
Web-it

### What and why?
We would like to build a web extension that emulates post-it notes. Keeping track of all your tasks can be difficult, and having all of it in one place makes doing those tasks easier. 

### For whom?
This software is primarily for students and office workers. 

### How?
Users will be able to create web-it notes that will always appear on their browser while they have a task to do. The notes can be minimized and have a timer for each task. Users can set priorities to each note and it will organize itself accordingly. Different colors can be used to signify different categories. 

### Scope
The programmers may have to familiarize themselves with how to make a web extension and learn javascript. There are also a number of features to implement. It is not too ambitious as the task is fairly straightforward.
